      I'm currently working as Senior Software Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> building things for the mobile with some awesome people.

    <p>
      As an engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably trekking, or on a road trip,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
